After the third move, its choice is determined from the 3 preceding outcomes in the following manner. Let A be the sum formed by counting the other's defection as 2 points and one's own as 1 point, and giving weights of 16, 4, and 1 to the preceding three moves in chronological order. The choice can be described as defecting only when A equals 1, 6, 7, 17, 22, 23, 26, 29, 30, 31, 33, 38, 39, 45, 49, 54, 55, 58, or 61.

This rule was designed for use in laboratory experiments as a stooge which had a memory and appeared to be trustworthy, potentially cooperative, but not gullible  (Nydegger, 1978). \n The program begins with tit for tat for the first three moves, except that if it was the only one to cooperate on the first move and the only one to defect on the second move, it defects on the third move. After the     third move, its choice is determined from the 3 preceding outcomes in the following manner. \n .. math::A = 16 a_1 + 4 a_2 + a_3 \nWhere :math:`a_i` is dependent on the outcome of the previous :math:`i` th round.

In general, the length of retaliation is increased by one for each departure from mutual cooperation. This rule is described with its strategic implications in Shubik (1970). Further treatment of its is given in. \n There is some room for interpretation as to how the strategy reacts to a defection on the turn where it starts to cooperate once more. In Shubik (1970) the strategy is described as: \nI will play my move 1 to begin with and will continue to do so, so long as my information shows that the other player has chosen his move 1. If my information tells me he has used move 2, then I will use move 2 for the immediate k subsequent periods, after which I will resume using move 1. If he uses his move 2 again after I have resumed using move 1, then I will switch to move 2 for the k + 1 immediately subsequent periods . . . and so on, increasing my retaliation by an extra period for each departure from the (1, 1) steady state.\n\n This is interpreted as: \n The player cooperates, if when it is cooperating, the opponent defects it defects for k rounds. After k rounds it starts cooperating again and   increments the value of k if the opponent defects again.")

P is adjusted if the other player seems random, very cooperative, or very uncooperative. P is also adjusted after move 130 if the rule has a lower score than the other player. Unfortunately, the complex process of adjustment frequently left the probability of cooperation in the 30% to 70% range, and therefore the rule appeared random to many other players. Given the lack of detail this strategy is implemented based on the final sentence of the description which is to have a cooperation probability that is uniformly random in the 30 to 70% range.")
