The project main goal is to try and simulate the axelrod experiment, more info on that when the app is started.
To start the program type "uv run -n streamlit run .\1_ðŸ“š_Documentation.py" in the terminal, to end it just close the web page.
It migth take some time to process and do the simulation so be patient.
The project is divided in 4 parts, documentation, tournament (where u can simulate a tournament), match(like a tournament but 1v1) and reference.
